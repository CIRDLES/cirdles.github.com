The following is a very basic walkthrough of some of Topsoil’s features. For more detailed information on importing data into Topsoil, see <a href="#importing">How to Import Data</a>.

1.	Open Topsoil. An about page will pop up, simply click anywhere off of the page to dismiss it.

2.	From the menu bar, select Data Table > Open Example Data Table > Uranium-Lead. This will populate Topsoil with some sample data from a Uranium-Lead analysis.

3.	Underneath the table is a section labeled “Plot Manager”, containing several options for manipulating a plot, which we have yet to generate! Click the button “Generate Plot”.

4.	A separate window should have appeared, with the plot inside of it. From “Plot Manager”, click the check box “[Unct.](#unct) Ellipses”. There should now be uncertainty ellipses surrounding the data points on the plot. You can change the color of these ellipses at any time using the color picker next to the check box.

5.	Now turn on the check box that reads “Wetherill Concordia Line”.

6.	Click-and-drag and zoom inside of the plot until you get to a position you like. If you get too far away from the original view, click the “Re-center” button above the plot to re-center the view to the data.

7.	Click the button “Save as SVG”, and save the file as something like “testPlot.svg”.

8.	Back in the main window, from the menu bar, select Project > Save Project As. This option lets you save your current working state as a .topsoil file, so when you open this file again, your tables and plots will be automatically loaded.

9.	Save the project as something like “test.topsoil”.

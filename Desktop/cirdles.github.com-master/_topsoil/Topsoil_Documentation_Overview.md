Topsoil is a desktop application and Java library that creates interactive data visualizations for geochronological data. ”Topsoil” is an anagram of “Isoplot”, the name of [an enormously successful Microsoft Excel Add-In with similar capabilities developed by Kenneth Ludwig](http://www.bgc.org/isoplot_etc/isoplot.html), which now works only in older versions of Excel.

Using Topsoil, a user is able to manually enter data, or import from delimited data formats, such as .csv, .tsv, and .txt. This data is stored in the form of tables, which can be organized and edited by the user. The table is used to create a plot which is freely explorable, and with several built-in plot features that can be toggled on or off. Which plot features are available is dependent on the isotope system of the given table; that is, whether the data is from a Uranium-Lead or Uranium-Thorium analysis. More isotope systems will become available to the user in the future.

Plots can be saved in .svg format, so the image can be scaled up or down without any sacrifice in resolution. Tables can be exported to .csv, .tsv, or .txt. In addition, the user may choose to save the working state of their project in a .topsoil file, which will store a user's open tables and plots.

**UPDATE March 2019**

Squid3 was presented at the IX SHRIMP 2018 Workshop in South Korea and a tutorial
workshop held.  Since then, we have incorporated feedback and advanced the design and functionality of
Squid3 with a new release: Squid3v1.1.0 on 4 March 2019.

**HISTORY**

Squid 3.0 was proposed as the project name for replacing Squid 2.50 during the VIII SHRIMP 2016 Workshop in Granada.

Since early 2016, Jim Bowring and Simon Bodorkos produced the open-source program Calamari as a proof-of-concept that we could
successfully port the arithmetic of Ken Ludwig's Squid 2.5 to Java. Simon has documented that effort <a href="https://github.com/CIRDLES/Squid/wiki" target="_blank">here</a>.



The details of Simon's explorations and
explanations of Squid 2.5 to date are found here:
<a href="https://github.com/CIRDLES/ET_Redux/wiki/SHRIMP:-Intro" target="_blank">SHRIMP data processing</a>.

The program Calamari is explained <a href="https://github.com/bowring/Calamari/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">here</a>.

The latest version of Calamari is <a href="https://github.com/bowring/Calamari/releases" target="_blank">here</a>.

Once you have obtained your SESAR ID you can use this to register a sample. Your sample will be given a unique IGSN number. ET_Redux uses the IGSN as a source for metadata. You can now pull all of the metadata from SESAR to process the sample and ET_Redux can upload the data processing into Geochron - selecting public will make the samples viewable on a map. This functionality will allow samples to be viewable throughout the world.

### Getting Your GeoPassId

Visit <a href="http://www.geochron.org/" target="_blank">geochron.org</a> to start the sign up process. Click on "My Account" to be directed to a login page. If you do not already have an account, click the "Sign up now!" link below the login form. Fill in the necessary fields and press the "Submit Registration" button. You will recieve a confirmation email with a link to confirm your account.

Remember your username and password. This login information will be needed while using ET_Redux.

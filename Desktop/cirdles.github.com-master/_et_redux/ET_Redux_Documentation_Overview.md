ET&#95;Redux is CIRDLES' open-source flagship cyber infrastructure product that  functions as a stand-alone desktop application hosted on Github. ET_Redux was previously named U-Pb_Redux, but in January of 2015 was renamed to reflect its expanding functionality and its sponsor, <a href="http://earth-time.org/" target="_blank">EARTHTIME</a>. ET&#95;Redux runs on 64-bit Unix, Linux, Mac, and Windows machines. The program requires a runtime environment of Java 1.8 or later. Get the latest Java Runtime Environment <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
ET&#95;Redux can be downloaded for free by clicking the link above, which will take you to the repository. Click the ET&#95;Redux-x.y.z.jar file, where x, y, and z are integers together representing the version of ET&#95;Redux. It was produced by CIRDLES.org as the successor to U-Pb&#95;Redux in January, 2015, with the initials "ET" referring to its sponsor [EARTHTIME](http://www.earth-time.org). ET&#95;Redux is cyber infrastructure for geochronologists that automates workflows from sample collection to publicly archiving of results into the NSF-sponsored [Geochron](http://www.geochron.org) community database. ET&#95;Redux exports analysis results as an [aliquot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EARTHTIME/Schema/master/AliquotXMLSchema.xsd) XML file, which can be exported to Geochron or stored and shared as desired.  ET_Redux currently serves the ID-TIMS and LAICP-MS U-Pb geochronology communities and is funded 2014 - 2017 by NSF to extend to U-series analyses.

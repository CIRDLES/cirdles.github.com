1. Consider using the following view options singly or in combination to explore your data:
  * Y-axis Scaling set to Independent
  * Show All Local Y-axis
  * Make horizonal zoom very tight to highlight patterns in data
2. Start with the default "Intercept" method tab.
3. Review the reference materials to make sure ratios are within acceptable rages. It will be very clear when an analysis is bad. You will either see a very large scatter in data points or the fit line will be far off the data points.  Be sure to select the appropriate fit functions on a ratio-by-ratio basis, or even for each graph.
4. Click "Show Session" button.
5. The time-based session views for each ratio plot the reference materials and their 1-sigma absolute uncertainties in black and over-dispersion of uncertainties in red, if calculated. Each session can be fitted with a choice of mean, line, exponential or spline functions.
6. To remove a data point for a reference material, hover over the black dot and right click. You will be asked to â€œexclude this fraction", click on it and the black dot will change to red indicating it has been removed.
7. Once you have removed all unwanted data points you MUST click "Refit" on the left update the plot and MSWD.
8. Next, click "Fit Unknowns" and evaluate each fraction and ratio for the unknowns and the secondary reference materials, which are also treated as unkowns.
9. When you are happy with your fits, to complete your reduction click "Update Report Table", which will remain grayed out until it finishes and then returns to the color white.
10. Return to the main window showing the data table and click "Sample Dates" in the bottom right to launch the sample date manager with the concordia, weighted means, and PDF plots and views.

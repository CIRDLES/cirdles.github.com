The Live Workflow mode establishes a direct link between Tripoli and ET_Redux. To enable Live Workflow, you must create a folder called "SampleMetaData" and then click the *Set SampleMetaData Folder* button. Tripoli must also be told the location of this SampleMetaData folder.  In Tripoli, point to this SampleMetaData folder with the *Set Live Workflow Data Folder* item from the Control Panel menu. Clicking the *START Live Workflow* button at the bottom of ET_Reduxâ€™s main screen immediately imports data from Tripoli and prompts ET_Redux to update its calculations.

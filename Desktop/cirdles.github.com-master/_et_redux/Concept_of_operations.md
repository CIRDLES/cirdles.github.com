ET_Redux provides sophisticated graphical and statistical tools to assist with data ingestion and organization, data reduction, uncertainty propagation, visualizations, publication-ready vectorized tables and plots, and one-click archiving. These include interactive data tables, concordia and weighted mean plots, dynamic decomposition of uncertainties into contributions from individual sources, and algorithms for propagation of systematic uncertainties in tracer calibration and decay constants.

ET_Redux has pioneered the seamless integration of automated archiving of data and results into the NSF-sponsored [GeoChron](http://geochron.org) community database. ET_Redux produces a standardized output detailing analysis results as an 'aliquot' XML file that can exported to GeoChron or stored and shared as needed.Â  An important contribution is ET_Redux's compilation mode where one or several aliquot files from GeoChron or elsewhere can be compiled and visualized together, giving the user instant access to large published datasets. 

ET_Redux currently serves the [ID-TIMS](http://cirdles.org/community/u-pb-idtims/) and [LAICP-MS](http://cirdles.org/community/u-pb-laicpms/) U-Pb geochronology communities as described.  We are currently funded by NSF to extend ET_Redux's architecture to <a href="http://earthcube.org/group/cyberinfrastructure-u-series-geochronologic-data" target="_blank">U-series</a> analyses.

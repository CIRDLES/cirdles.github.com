1. Click "Save and Monitor/Process Raw Data"
2. Once the live data monitor is launched you will have to wait for at least 3-4 analysis to be recorded by the mass spectrometer software and processed by ET_Redux before seeing any data.
3. To reject an analysis, right click on the selected <a href="#fraction">fraction</a> name in the report table located in the bottom portion of the manager and it will be sent to the rejected fractions tab but will still be reduced.
4. To look at individual <a href="#sample">samples</a> (Reference Materials or Unknowns), double click on the project name in the panel to the left of the concordia, and a drop down menu will show all available groups to view on Concordia and on the PDF.  Note that the reference materials both primary and secondary will not appear in the PDF view.
5. To set filters for percent discordance and percent uncertainty, adjust the sliders in the panel under the PDF. To apply them to the Concordia plot, select "apply filters" checkbox under the Concordia.  To set the sliders to the default values specified in the lab data manager, click "Default", and to clear the filters, click "Clear".
6. To change what dates are shown on the PDF, select one of the three dates (6/8, 6/7, or best date). We suggest the best date option.
7. Best date filter can be changed while you are looking at unknowns in Concordia space by sliding the blue best date handle on the vertical axis.
8. When a fraction is removed be patient as it will take until the next primary reference material fraction to update the session.
9. If you need to refresh, click "Refresh Views"
10. Wait until the run has completed and proceed to Project Raw Data Manager (see below).

*The current documentation applies to Chroni version 2.1.1*

Currently, CHRONI supports Android and IOS devices.

1. Install our most recent CHRONI application from [the Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.cirdles.chroni&hl=en) or the App Store on your IOS device.
OR
You can navigate to the [CHRONI Repository](https://github.com/CIRDLES/CHRONI) on Github to download CHRONI.
2. Once the CHRONI application is downloaded to your device, navigate to the app and open it in a location where your device receives internet connection.
    * Internet connection is needed to initialize the application because the default Report Settings file must be fetched from [cirdles.org](https://cirdles.org).
3. Once the app is opened, you will be faced with a screen that is titled Manage Report and to the right of that there is a menu icon and a login icon from left to right. When you click on the login icon, you will be able to login to your geochron account. If you don't currently have a geochron, you can [sign up]().
    * The top field labeled Aliquot is where you can access the default Aliquot in the application, as well as downloaded Aliquots.
    * The bottom field labeled Report Settings is where you can access the default Report Settings, as well as downloaded Report Settings.
4. When the menu icon is clicked, the option beneath "Manage Report Table" is "Download." When "Download" is clicked, you will be faced with a screen that says "Geochron IGSN" and "Website URL." The Geochron IGSN option allows the user to enter a Geochron IGSN in the first text field and Downloaded File Name allows the user to enter the Downloaded Filename into the second text field. After the text fields are filled out, click "Download" in order to download the file from Geochron. The "Website URL" option will also allow ther user to dowload files from Geochron but the first text field requires a Website URL of the XML file the user is trying to obtain.
5. Underneath the "Download" option is "History." When "History," is clicked the user will be able to see the files that the user has opened.
6. When the user clicks the "About" option, the user will be navigated to the About page, which explains CHRONI's purpose and origins, as well as how the user can contact one of the developers.
7. When the user clicks "Help," the user will be redirected to the CHRONI Project page on cirdles.org.

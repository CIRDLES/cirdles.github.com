Report settings are XML files created through ET Redux in which the user specifies which data sets and units they would
like to display. The user can decide what columns appear, the amount of significant digits they would like to display, and more.

<b>Downloading</b><br>
To obtain custom report settings, the user needs to be sent report settings from colleagues or create their own through
ET Redux. To access information about using ET Redux, click <a href="http://cirdles.org/projects/et_redux/#report-settings" target="_blank">here</a>.
<br>Once you have downloaded a report setting to your device, you can use the new import feature to put into CHRONI's file system.
Open up the CHRONI menu and then click on the import activity. Select the file you want to import from and click import and it
will simply transfer any report settings and/or aliquot files you have in that folder.


1. From the home screen, click the Report Settings button to arrive at the Report Settings screen.
2. The Current Settings will be "Default Report Settings."
3. Click the plus sign next to the Device file input form to choose a report setting. Then, click the Open button to be taken to the Aliquot table and a notification will say "Your current table info has been stored!"
4. Click the Cancel button in order to return to Chroni's home screen.

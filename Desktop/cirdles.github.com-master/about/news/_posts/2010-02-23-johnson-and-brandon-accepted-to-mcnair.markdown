CIRDLES students Brittany Johnson and Danielle Brandon are two of the first 25 students to be accepted into the Ronald E. McNair Post-Baccalaureate Achievement Program for Summer 2010 and Academic Year 2010-2011. As a McNair Scholar each student will earn a $2,100 stipend for her summer research experience, and a $600 scholarship during the academic year, as well as participate in service learning, coursework, workshops and advising to prepare participants for successful completion of graduate degrees. The McNair Scholars Program at the College of Charleston is a four-year renewable TRiO grant from the U.S. Department of Education. $220,000 in federal funding is provided each year to help 25 first-generation college students, low-income and/or under-represented undergraduates prepare for and succeed in doctoral programs.

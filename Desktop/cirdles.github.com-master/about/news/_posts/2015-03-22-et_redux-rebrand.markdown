ET_Redux is the flagship cyber infrastructure product of CIRDLES.  ET_Redux was previously known as U-Pb_Redux, but in January of 2015, was renamed to reflect its expanding functionality and its sponsor, EARTHTIME (EARTH-TIME.org).

Our new home will be: 
<a href="https://github.com/CIRDLES/ET_Redux" target="_blank">https://github.com/CIRDLES/ET_Redux</a>.

McLean Regression is a desktop application that implements the algorithm titled 'McLean Regression.' The algorithm is "applied to Pb data measured by TIMS with a silica gel activator that define(s) a fractionation line in a three dimensional log-ratio space." For information on McLean Regression you can read the [paper](https://github.com/CIRDLES/cirdles.github.com/blob/master/assets/documents/McLean%20-%20Straight%20line%20regression%20through%20data%20with%20correlated%20uncertainties%20in%20two%20or%20more%20dimensions%2C%20with%20an%20application%20to%20kinetic%20isotope%20fractionation%20(GCA%202014).pdf) directly or visit the [github repository](https://github.com/CIRDLES/McLeanRegression).

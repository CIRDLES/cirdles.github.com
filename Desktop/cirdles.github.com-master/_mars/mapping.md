Navigate to the Mapping tab to prepare the samples to be uploaded. The Scripps mapping file can be found in the file path MARS/user/scrippsMap.js. The file format is CSV for all files. MARS currently services the cores collection at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and so some sample data for testing can be downloaded from the [Github page](https://github.com/CIRDLES/MARS/wiki/Scripps-Cores-Test-Data). Select the file(s) for the data and after all the fields are filled in, click the Proceed button.

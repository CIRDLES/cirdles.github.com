After setting up the mapping, all of the samples will be listed in the window with pertinent metadata. Click the Upload button in the top right corner, and the samples will be uploaded to SESARâ€™s test database. If the upload is successful, a new field called IGSN will pop up for each of the samples in MARS. If you want to verify that the samples uploaded, you can view your samples by logging in to [SESAR](https://geopass.iedadata.org/josso/).

Squid 3.0 was proposed as the project name for replacing Squid 2.50 during the VIII SHRIMP 2016 Workshop in Granada.

Since early 2016, Jim Bowring and Simon Bodorkos produced the open-source program Calamari as a proof-of-concept that we could
successfully port the arithmetic of Ken Ludwig's Squid 2.5 to Java. Simon has documented that effort <a href="https://github.com/CIRDLES/Squid/wiki" target="_blank">here</a>.



The details of Simon's explorations and
explanations of Squid 2.5 to date are found here:

The program Calamari is explained <a href="https://github.com/bowring/Calamari/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">here</a>.

The latest version of Calamari is <a href="https://github.com/bowring/Calamari/releases" target="_blank">here</a>.
